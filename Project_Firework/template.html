Hello! everyone, My name is Pavithira. I study BSC Computer Science at City University Of London. I have created webpages using HTML & CSS at college. But this was the first time i have used processing (Java) to create a project. And i really enjoyed and learned many things from the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City. I love playing Basketball, Badminton and Cricket. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Fireworks using different shapes</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I developed a fireworks program that displays an explosion when the mouse clicks by adding 100 different objects (circles, Square & Stars ) that would go off in random directions. I have used both mousepressed and keypressed function in my code, so different shapes will generate when the user press different keys. 

Try pressing the following keys to see fireworks in different shapes and different sizes.
q,w,e,r
a,s,d,f
z,x,c,v.
    </p>
